Dude, just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘦𝘥 The Amateur and I’m like, what?! Seriously, the plot twist in the middle had me doubting if I’d actually 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥ed the   correctly or if I was just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 someone’s weird edit. You know that feeling when you think you’ve got it all figured out but then boom, curveball. 🙄 Like, can we talk about the part where everything goes completely sideways? Anyway, I’m not saying it’s awful or anything, just... baffling.

So, there's this character, right? And he's got that whole mysterious vibe going on. But halfway through, it feels like the writers just went, Hey, let's flip the script! 😂 One minute you're invested, and then you’re wondering if they fell asleep writing it. It’s exhausting, but in that I can’t look away kind of way. I guess that’s what you get for not checking reviews before telling everyone to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  . Live and learn, I guess.

> But then the soundtrack! Omggg, absolute genius. It’s like whoever curated it just took over the whole vibe. Almost makes you wonder if the   was just a side note for showcasing those sweet tracks. Each scene hits different when the music is on point. Kinda felt like my dentist playlist at one point, lol, minus the stress of waiting with a numb mouth.

Major props for keeping things unpredictable though, not everything can be a neatly wrapped-up gift, ya know? Maybe that's why people keep buzzing about it. Although, I’ll admit, it left me oddly tired... or maybe I’m just tired in general? Ah, whatever. 😂 But for real, the ending. Shook. Can’t believe they did that. Are ambiguous endings still a thing?

Now I need a breather, maybe some coffee. 💤✨ Anyway, tell me you’ve seen it! Need someone to nerd out with or at least giggle about how random it was. I'll be here, trying to piece my thoughts back together, one questionable plot twist at a time.
